                <h1 class="title">Boy Scouts</h1>
                <p class="body">I have been doing boy scouts since fifth grade or 2015. Here I gained many friends and a new confidence to go out into the wild. I also learned to abide by the scout motto, <strong>Be Prepared</strong>. This has resonated throughout my life on many diffent levels. Literally, it has taught me to be prepared in everything I do and never "wing it". For example I would always be prepared for a test, or for a class, before going. On a spiritual level, it has shown me that I need to remain calm and accept the reality that anything can happen, and that I need to adapt to those conditions to survive. For example, I accept the possiblity that there might be something that goes wrong in a snow campout, and mentally prepare for what I would do. Mostly, Boy Scouts has taught me how to be a better person overall!</strong></p>

                        <p class="body">Here, in the first rank, "Scout", I learned the scout motto and law. I really didn't understand the true meaning of these and how they are until second class. Another thing that happened while I was in this class is that i went on my first scout camp! I learned some knots and how to put up a tent.</p>

                        <p class="body">In the next rank, Tenderfoot, I learned more knots and other survival techniques. I got a few merit badged and learned a lot of first aid. After hearing many stories I started to grasp the full meaning of the scout motto, Be Prepared.</p>

                        <p class="body">With Second Class came a new challenge, Scout Camp. If yo udont knwo what that is, Scout Camp is basically a camp where you are in teh wilderness or mountains for a full week doing merit badges. Here I relised that all campouts are not going to end with fun and games, and that some campouts can go terribly wrong if you don't prepare for them. I also started to learn more and more on what it truly meant to be a scout.</p>

                        <p class="body">In First Class i realised that I was incoming to eagle. With that sudden shock, I started to get to the heart of scouting, and how I could actually make a impact with my scouting. I started to think about my eagle and got the idea of either related to ,reading, or computers.</p>

                        <p class="body">While I was a Star Scout, I had my second scout camp. This was a very important scout camp for in this scout camp I actually learned how to swim in high altitudes. Since the last camp, where I felt entrapped and out of breath while swimming, I grew afraid of the lakes. I decided to just jump in and swim, and with many strenuous strokes, I managed to get the swimming merit badge!</p>
