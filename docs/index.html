            </h2>
            <p class="text has-indent">Hi! My name is Neel Redkar and I currently go to Windemere Ranch Middle School. Since I was 9 I loved to program and code! I love the ability fo ryou to convert anything in your head, or any idea, into a reality! Some other things I like to do is to do math and read. I also like doing the science fair because not only do I get to do a cool science project, but I get to show it! More on that in my Extracurriculars though. One last thing I like to do is debate. I am in LD or Lincoln Douglas debate which is moral based. This basically means that you get to decide on which morals you should judge the round. I also have a dog that I love a lot and is currently 4 years old! </p>

You also get to be in the sun and wilderness for an extended period of time which can calm you down. The best thing in general is that you have to survive out there with just what you have and nothing else!</p>
